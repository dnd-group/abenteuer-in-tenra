        <description>
            <p>This necklace has 3 magic beads made from aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber, bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead loses its magic.</p>
            <p class="indent">Six types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the type of each bead on the necklace or determines it randomly. <b>The necklace has the following beads: Bless, Cure Wounds (2nd level), Lesser restoration.</b> A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a bonus action (using your spell save DC if a save is necessary). Once a magic bead's spell is cast, that bead can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>

            <p>Vow. While wearing the ring you gain a +1 Bonus on all saving throws. When you break your word or lie, the bonus is suspended until the next dawn the ring flares brightly, dealing 1d6 fire damage to you as it gains a new check. If you roll a 6 on this fire damage, the ring shatters completely and is destroyed.</p>
            <p>Sunkiss. As an action, you can cause the ring to detonate. Each creature within 20 feet of you must make a DC13 Dex saving throw, taking 8d6 fire damage and 8d6 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You automatically fail the saving throw. After you use this property, the ring is destroyed.</p>
